  <h1>Webpack Canary</h1>
  <p>Run dependency examples against webpack versions to detect incompatibilities.<p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

### Squawk

Expected usage of the canary is to check multiple versions of webpack against a set of dependencies and squawk if there are any failures. The `squawk` task is a runner to just that. Webpack versions are stored in `webpack-versions.json` and dependency versions are stored in `dependency-versions.json`.

Use `npm run squawk` to run all dependencies against all versions of webpack, and generate a report with successes and failures. This command does not take any flags.

### CLI Interface

To run a specific dependency version against a specific version of webpack, use the canary CLI interface

```
node index.js --webpack=<webpack_reference> --dependency=<dependency_reference>
```

 - `--webpack` can be a version or path to remote repository
 - `--dependency` can be a dependency name (with or without version) or path to remote repository

#### Example

```
# Published versions in registry
node index.js --webpack=2.2 --dependency=raw-loader

# Development versions in remote repositories
node index.js --webpack=webpack/webpack#master --dependency=https://github.com/alistairjcbrown/raw-loader/
```

<h2 align="center">Compatibility</h2>

A dependency must include an `examples` directory which contains an example setup with corresponding webpack config. This config is run with the installed webpack version to confirm compatibility.
